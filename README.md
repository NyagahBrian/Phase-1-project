OVERVIEW.

Following the creation of movie studio, we have been tasked by Microsoft, who have no idea about making films, to identify what makes a film perform well at the box office. After identifying return on investment (RoI) as the primary metric of success, we narrowed down the datasets provided to the top 200 most grossing movies worldwide then calculated the RoI for each. After plotting several scatter and bar plots comparing runtime, production budget, gross revenue, release date, genre and directors to come up with conclusions and recommendations. 

PROBLEM STATEMENT. 

■ Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. I am exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. The findings must then translate those findings into actionable outputs.
